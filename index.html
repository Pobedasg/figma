                      The band members (Zhenya Volodchenko, Amil Nasirov, Ramil Nasirov) were born and raised in the
                      small town of Blyzniuky in the Kharkiv region. They talk about their childhood with laughter and
                      enthusiasm: running away from their parents, skipping school and stealing metal. They wrote
                      humorous rap lyrics and filmed funny performances on their smartphones and posted them on YouTube.

                        &#34;Teacher&#34;. Dasha can also be seen in other videos by this band.<br />The band&#39;s
                        first works can be described as &#34;rustic aesthetics&#34;. The tracks of the rap collective
                        are an assortment of songs about rural toilets, socks with flip-flops and cigarettes. The guys
                        have not forgotten about the use of surzhik. Fans say that it is enough to listen to at least
                        one track of the band to &#34;suppress&#34; the melancholy that has come over them.

                      Yevhen Volodchenko, joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the Nasirov brothers actively
                      volunteer and raise funds to support the army.
